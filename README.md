Supermarket Sales 

"This project is a dashboard focused on analyzing supermarket sales. The entire structure was built using Python, along with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for graphical visualization. The dashboard presents the following information: revenue by unit over the months, the best-selling product type, the contribution of each store, the predominant payment method, and the average rating of each store."
